# This is a placeholder for the ClassSphere Administration Dashboard image
# 
# The actual image should be:
# - High resolution (1920x1080 or higher)
# - PNG format for transparency support
# - Optimized for web (compressed but clear)
# - Shows the dark mode dashboard with:
#   - ClassSphere logo and navigation
#   - Key metrics cards (Total Courses, Active Students, etc.)
#   - Charts (Weekly Submissions, Course Completion Rate)
#   - Course overview table
#   - Mock data indicators
#
# To add the actual image:
# 1. Save the dashboard screenshot as admin-dashboard-preview.png
# 2. Place it in this directory
# 3. Ensure it's under 1MB for GitHub compatibility
